    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Kelly's Criterion Calculator ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use our Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integrated with ChatGPT.</p>
    <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 MCP Server (Primary Service)</h3>
    <p>The core MCP server operates in a <strong>stateless manner</strong> and does not persistently store any user data. During a calculation session, we temporarily process the following information:</p>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Data Type</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Persistence</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bankroll amount</td>
            <td>Calculate optimal bet size</td>
            <td>Not stored</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Betting odds</td>
            <td>Perform Kelly Criterion calculation</td>
            <td>Not stored</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Win probability</td>
            <td>Calculate expected value</td>
            <td>Not stored</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kelly fraction preference</td>
            <td>Adjust calculation conservatism</td>
            <td>Not stored</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Locale/language preference</td>
            <td>Provide localized responses</td>
            <td>Not stored</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> None of the above data is logged, saved to a database, or retained after your session ends.</p>

        <li><strong>CORS Protection:</strong> Cross-origin requests are restricted to authorized domains</li>
        <li><strong>HTTPS:</strong> All data transmission occurs over encrypted connections</li>
        <li><strong>No Logging:</strong> The MCP server does not log user calculation data</li>
        <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> Request rate limiting prevents abuse</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we strive to protect your data, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
