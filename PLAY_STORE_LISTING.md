```
Betgistics is a sports analytics and bankroll management education platform built on rigorous mathematical foundations. Whether you are a student of probability theory, a fantasy sports enthusiast, or someone who wants to understand the mathematics behind sports betting markets, Betgistics gives you the analytical tools used by professionals.

KELLY CRITERION CALCULATOR
At the core of Betgistics is a full implementation of the Kelly Criterion, the formula developed by John L. Kelly Jr. at Bell Labs in 1956 for optimal position sizing. Input your estimated win probability, the offered odds, and your bankroll to receive a mathematically optimal stake recommendation. Supports fractional Kelly (half-Kelly, quarter-Kelly) for more conservative sizing strategies. The calculator displays your edge over the implied probability, expected value, decimal odds conversion, and a clear recommendation on whether a position has positive expected value.

WALTERS PROTOCOL PROBABILITY ESTIMATORS
Estimate game outcome probabilities using weighted statistical models inspired by professional handicapping methodology. Sport-specific estimators are calibrated for:

- NFL Football: Weighted analysis of points differential (40%), yards differential (25%), and turnover differential (20%), with home field advantage and league-standard deviation modeling.
- NBA Basketball: Weighted analysis of points differential (35%), field goal percentage differential (30%), rebound margin (20%), and turnover margin (15%), with home court advantage calibrated for pro and college levels.
- College Football (CFB) and College Basketball (CBB): Separate calibrations with adjusted standard deviations that reflect the higher variance in collegiate competition.
- NHL Hockey: A 4-step projection algorithm using expected goals (xG), goaltender Goals Saved Above Expected (GSAx), high-danger chance frequency for pace adjustment, and special teams mismatch detection.

Each estimator uses normal distribution modeling (z-scores) to convert projected margins into cover probabilities.

AI-POWERED MATCHUP ANALYSIS
Get a second opinion with AI-driven matchup breakdowns powered by Google Gemini. The AI evaluates team strengths and weaknesses, recent form, injuries, venue factors, and historical matchup context to produce probability estimates alongside qualitative analysis. Use it to validate your statistical models or to analyze matchups where data is limited.

REAL TEAM STATISTICS
Access current-season NFL, NBA, NHL, CFB, and CBB team statistics directly within the app. Look up any team by name, city, or abbreviation and retrieve the exact metrics needed for probability estimation -- points per game, defensive efficiency, turnover rates, shooting percentages, expected goals, and more.

BET TRACKING AND BANKROLL MANAGEMENT
Log every analytical position with full details: sport, teams, odds, stake, and your estimated probability. Track outcomes over time and review your complete history. Monitor your bankroll trajectory to understand how well your probability estimates perform against actual results. This is the feedback loop that turns analytics into skill.

ODDS CONVERSION UTILITY
Instantly convert between American, decimal, and fractional odds formats. See the implied probability behind any line at a glance.

EDUCATIONAL FOCUS
Betgistics is designed as an educational analytics tool. It teaches the mathematics of probability estimation, expected value, and the Kelly Criterion -- concepts that apply to investing, risk management, and decision-making far beyond sports. No bets are placed through this app. No gambling services are offered. This is a calculator and statistical analysis platform.

Built for learners, analysts, and anyone who appreciates the intersection of mathematics and sports.

## 4. Category

**Primary:** Finance
**Secondary:** Sports

Rationale: The app centers on mathematical bankroll management and position sizing (Kelly Criterion), which is a financial calculation tool. The sports statistics serve as inputs to financial/risk models. "Finance" also distances the listing from gambling-category scrutiny.
