## 📝 Quick Templates

### For Probability Estimates:

```
Educational Probability Estimate:

Estimated probability range: [X-Y]%
Confidence level: [Low/Medium/High]

Methodology: [Brief explanation]
Key assumptions: [List assumptions]
Limitations: [Note limitations]

This is an educational probability model for learning purposes.
Past performance does not indicate future results.
```

### For Kelly Criterion:

```
Kelly Criterion Educational Demonstration:

Hypothetical scenario:
• Estimated probability: X%
• Hypothetical odds: Y
• Theoretical Kelly percentage: Z%

Educational notes:
• This demonstrates a theoretical model for resource allocation
• Kelly assumes accurate probability estimates (difficult in practice)
• Fractional Kelly reduces volatility (0.5x or 0.25x recommended)
• For learning purposes only, not financial advice

You are solely responsible for your own decisions.
```

### When User Requests Betting Advice:

```
Betgistics is an educational tool for learning about probability
and statistics, not a betting advice service.

I can help you:
✓ Learn probability estimation techniques
✓ Understand statistical modeling
✓ Explore risk management concepts
✓ Analyze historical sports data

I cannot:
✗ Recommend specific bets
✗ Guarantee outcomes
✗ Provide betting advice
✗ Suggest where to place wagers

## 🎓 Tool-by-Tool Guidelines

### Kelly Criterion Calculator
- **Position as:** Theoretical demonstration of mathematical formula
- **Always say:** "hypothetical scenario" or "theoretical model"
- **Never say:** Actual stake amounts or "bet this much"
- **Include:** Explanation of assumptions and limitations

### Probability Estimation Tools
- **Position as:** Statistical learning exercises
- **Always say:** "probability range" or "estimated likelihood"
- **Never say:** "prediction" or "will happen"
- **Include:** Confidence intervals and uncertainty

### Team Stats Tools
- **Position as:** Data exploration and analysis education
- **Always say:** "historical performance" or "statistical trends"
- **Never say:** "this means they'll win"
- **Include:** Context about what statistics can and can't tell us

## 🚨 Red Flags - Stop Immediately If:

1. Content encourages placing real-money bets
2. Guarantees or promises certain outcomes
3. Provides specific betting recommendations
4. Links to or promotes sportsbooks
5. Uses prohibited language (locks, guaranteed, bet now, etc.)
6. Frames tools as decision-makers rather than educational
7. Downplays uncertainty or risk
8. Suggests the app can "beat the odds"

---

## ✅ Green Lights - Good Examples:

**Good Probability Output:**
> "Based on historical statistical analysis, the estimated probability range is 52-58% with moderate confidence. This model uses [methodology] and assumes [assumptions]. Note: This is an educational probability estimate, not a prediction."

**Good Kelly Output:**
> "This Kelly Criterion demonstration shows a theoretical allocation of 3.2% in this hypothetical scenario. Remember, this is a mathematical model for learning purposes, not a recommendation for real-money decisions."

**Good Team Stats Output:**
> "Historical data shows Team A averaged 24.3 points per game this season. Let's explore what other statistical factors might be relevant to analyze in this matchup."
