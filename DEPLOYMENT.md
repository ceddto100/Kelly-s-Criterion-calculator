# Deployment Guide - Render

This guide will help you deploy the Kelly Criterion MCP Server to Render.

## Overview

This project is a monorepo with multiple components:
- **mcp-server** - Primary application (Node.js/Express with Model Context Protocol)
- component - React widgets for ChatGPT
- frontend - Legacy React app
- backend - Legacy Node.js API

The Render deployment is configured to deploy the **mcp-server** as the primary service.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Render account](https://render.com) (free tier available)
2. This repository connected to your GitHub account
3. Optional: Gemini API key if you want AI-powered insights

## Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file in the root of your repository.

### Steps:

1. **Connect Repository to Render**
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select this repository

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Render will prompt you to set environment variables defined in `render.yaml`. You need to configure:

   **Required:**
   - `NODE_ENV` - Already set to `production`
   - `PORT` - Already set to `10000` (Render default)

   **Important:**
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - **CRITICAL for CORS**
     - After deployment, update this to include your Render URL
     - Format: `https://chatgpt.com,https://your-app-name.onrender.com`
     - Example: `https://chatgpt.com,https://kelly-criterion-mcp-server.onrender.com`

   **Optional:**
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Only needed if using AI-powered insights
     - Get your key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Apply" to create the service
   - Render will automatically build and deploy your application
   - First deployment takes 3-5 minutes

4. **Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS (Important!)**
   - Once deployed, copy your Render URL (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com`)
   - Go to your service ‚Üí Environment
   - Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to: `https://chatgpt.com,https://your-app.onrender.com`
   - Save changes (this will trigger a redeploy)

## Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Create New Web Service**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
   - Connect your repository

2. **Configure Service**
   - **Name:** kelly-criterion-mcp-server
   - **Runtime:** Node
   - **Build Command:** `cd mcp-server && npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command:** `cd mcp-server && npm start`
   - **Plan:** Free (or choose your preferred plan)

3. **Add Environment Variables** (see above section)

4. **Deploy**

## Verifying Deployment

Once deployed, test your endpoints:

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "name": "kelly-criterion-calculator",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Server Discovery
```bash
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "name": "Kelly Criterion MCP Server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Custom MCP server for Kelly Criterion calculations and probability estimation.",
  "mcp_endpoint": "/mcp",
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": [
      "kelly-calculate",
      "probability-estimate-football",
      "probability-estimate-basketball",
      "unit-calculate"
    ],
    "supports_streaming": true
  }
}
```

### MCP Endpoint (SSE)
The MCP endpoint at `/mcp` uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication.

Test with curl (will establish SSE connection):
```bash
curl -N https://your-app.onrender.com/mcp
```

## Connecting to ChatGPT

Once deployed, you can connect this MCP server to ChatGPT:

1. Go to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
2. Open GPT Builder or Custom GPT settings
3. Add your Render URL as an action endpoint: `https://your-app.onrender.com/mcp`
4. Configure authentication (if required)

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | No | 10000 | Server port (Render sets this automatically) |
| `NODE_ENV` | Yes | production | Node environment |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Yes | https://chatgpt.com | Comma-separated CORS origins |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | No | - | Google Gemini API key for AI insights |

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

**Issue:** Build fails with "Cannot find module"
- **Solution:** Ensure all dependencies are in `mcp-server/package.json`
- Run locally: `cd mcp-server && npm install && npm run build`

**Issue:** TypeScript compilation errors
- **Solution:** Fix type errors locally first
- Run: `cd mcp-server && npm run type-check`

### Runtime Errors

**Issue:** 502 Bad Gateway
- **Solution:** Check Render logs for startup errors
- Verify `dist/server.js` exists after build
- Ensure `PORT` environment variable is respected

**Issue:** CORS errors in browser
- **Solution:** Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to include your Render URL
- Format: `https://chatgpt.com,https://your-app.onrender.com`
- Remember to redeploy after updating environment variables

**Issue:** Health check failing
- **Solution:** Ensure `/health` endpoint is accessible
- Check that server is listening on the correct PORT
- Review application logs in Render dashboard

### Connection Issues

**Issue:** MCP connection not establishing
- **Solution:**
  - Verify SSE transport is working (curl the `/mcp` endpoint)
  - Check browser console for connection errors
  - Ensure CORS is properly configured

## Free Tier Limitations

Render's free tier includes:
- ‚úÖ 750 hours per month
- ‚úÖ Automatic SSL certificates
- ‚úÖ Custom domains
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cold starts take ~30 seconds

### Handling Cold Starts

When using the free tier, your service will spin down after inactivity. The first request after spin-down will take longer (~30s).

**Solutions:**
1. Upgrade to paid plan ($7/month) for always-on service
2. Use a service like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to ping your health endpoint
3. Accept cold starts for development/testing

## Updating Deployment

Render automatically deploys when you push to your main branch (if auto-deploy is enabled).

To manually trigger a deployment:
1. Go to your service in Render Dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"

## Logs and Monitoring

View logs in real-time:
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Click "Logs" tab

Logs include:
- Build output
- Application console logs
- Error messages
- Request logs

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:
1. Go to your service settings
2. Click "Custom Domain"
3. Add your domain
4. Update DNS records as instructed
5. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to include your custom domain

## Production Checklist

Before going to production:

- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes your Render URL
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Server discovery endpoint returns correct data
- [ ] MCP endpoint establishes SSE connection
- [ ] CORS properly configured for your client origins
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Logs reviewed for warnings/errors
- [ ] Consider upgrading to paid plan for always-on service
